## How it works

Prime Backup maintains a custom file pool to store the backup files. Every file in the pool is identified with the hash value of its content.
With that, Prime Backup can deduplicate files with same content, and only stores 1 copy of them, greatly reduced the burden on disk usage. 

Besides that, Prime Backup also supports compression on the stored files, which reduces the disk usage further more

PrimeBackup can store common file types, including regular files, directories, and symbolic links. For these 3 file types:

- Regular file: Prime Backup calculates its hash values first. If the hash does not exist in the file pool, 
  Prime backup will (compress and) store its content into a new blob in the file pool.
  The file status, including mode, uid, mtime etc., will be stored in the database
- Directory: Prime Backup will store its information in the database
- Symlink: Prime Backup will store the symlink itself, instead of the linked target

## Thanks

The idea for the hash-based file pool is inspired by https://github.com/z0z0r4/better_backup
